A Space Shooters Game Created Using Pygame

# What is this game?

In this game, the player controls a battleship which flies across the space. Enemies will move towards the bottom of the screen and some occasionally shoots lasers at the player. The goal of this endless game is to get to the highest level possible without dropping lives or health down to zero.

Both the player and ships have health indicated by healthbar below them. Health decreses on hit by the lasers shot or on collision. Player has a fixed number of lives. Lives decrease if the player fails to kill an enemy ship and it makes it across the screen. Once the healthbar of player reaches zero or lives count down to zero, the game is over.

The difficulty of the game progresses through the levels. The amount of enemies and their health increases with each level. On the flip side, the speed of the playerâ€™s ship and his health also increases with each level.
